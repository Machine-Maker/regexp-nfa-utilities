# regexp-nfa-utilities
A Project to parse a simplified Regular Expression, convert to epsilon-free NFAs and test membership


Comments from sam (can delete later)
So I think I have the Epsilon NFA parser down.
It's not extensively tested. I'm kind of sick of it at
this point and need a break. You can check out the code
and play around. If you see ways to improve it be my guest.
I was kind of stuck in the logic of it all so I'm sure there are
ways it can be improved/optimized. If it turns out not to
work at all... well we will cross that bridge when we get to it.
