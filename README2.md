# regexp-nfa-utilities
A Project to parse a simplified Regular Expression, convert to epsilon-free NFAs and test membership


I redid the Epsilon NFA data structure and the parser.

parser seems to require explicit concatenation a.a not aa as we would expect from the assignment but maybe we should notify this in the instructions
